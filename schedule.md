## Introduction

Project intro:
- This is an adventure game: show a quick demo
- Live-coding: show skeleton code in Python

Intro:
- "TW week in one day"
- 4 one-hour iterations - no a lot of time, so make it count
- There is project and user-stories, but you'll get a lot of freedom
- Start iteration with planning, but don't plan too much! 5-10 minutes discussion is probably enough
- At the end of each iteration, at least 1 new user story should be ready
- When something is working, **commit**

Setup:
- Select your teams (2/3 people + language)
- I suggest pair programming, you can alternate or one person can code the whole time
- Download the repo + run the program NOW.
- Then, there is some time for initial planning
- Write teams list on the whiteboard

## Iterations

- 50 minutes coding

- 5 minutes presentation

- 5 minutes retro. Write down 1 thing to CONTINUE / START / STOP

## Closing

- What did you learn?
- What would you change for next workshop?
